  return (
    <div>
      {processor === 'razorpay' && <RazorpayCheckout />}

### 3.4 Technical Architecture for Scale

#### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Indexes for common queries (add to migrations)
CREATE INDEX idx_goals_org_id ON goals(organization_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_goals_created_at ON goals(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_candidates_status ON candidates(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_cycle_id ON performance_reviews(cycle_id);

-- Partitioning for large tables (future)
CREATE TABLE goals_partitioned (
  id UUID,
  organization_id UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  -- other fields
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);
```

#### Caching Strategy
```typescript
// src/lib/cache/strategies.ts
export const CACHE_TTL = {
  USER_PROFILE: 3600, // 1 hour
  ORGANIZATION_SETTINGS: 3600,
  GOALS_LIST: 300, // 5 minutes (changes frequently)
  RECRUITMENT_METRICS: 600, // 10 minutes
  USER_PERMISSIONS: 1800, // 30 minutes
}

// Redis-backed caching
export async function getCachedGoals(orgId: string) {
  const cached = await redis.get(`goals:${orgId}`)
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached)
  
  const goals = await db.goal.findMany({
    where: { organizationId: orgId }
  })
  
  await redis.setex(
    `goals:${orgId}`,
    CACHE_TTL.GOALS_LIST,
    JSON.stringify(goals)
  )
  
  return goals
}
```

#### Rate Limiting Per Tier
```typescript
// src/lib/middleware/tier-rate-limiting.ts
export const RATE_LIMITS_BY_TIER = {
  free: {
    requests: 100,
    windowMs: 3600000, // 1 hour
    actions: ['read'],
  },
  pro: {
    requests: 5000,
    windowMs: 3600000,
    actions: ['read', 'write'],
  },
  enterprise: {
    requests: 50000,
    windowMs: 3600000,
    actions: ['read', 'write', 'bulk'],
  },
}

// Apply in API routes
export const withTierRateLimit = (handler: Handler) => {
  return async (req: Request) => {
    const org = await getOrgFromRequest(req)
    const tier = org.subscription_tier
    const limit = RATE_LIMITS_BY_TIER[tier]
    
    const result = await checkRateLimit(org.id, limit)
    if (!result.allowed) {
      return new Response('Rate limit exceeded', { status: 429 })
    }
    
    return handler(req)
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Expansion & Upsell Strategy

#### Land & Expand Motion
```
1. Land: Acquire customer on Free or Pro tier
   Target: SMB with 5-50 employees
   
2. Expansion: Grow with customer
   - Team growth → More team members needed
   - More features needed → Pro upgrade
   - Advanced features → Enterprise upgrade
   
3. Result:
   - Average LTV: $1,500-3,000 (2-3 years)
   - CAC payback: 2-3 months
   - NRR: 120% (net revenue retention, includes expansion)
```

#### Upgrade Triggers
```
Free → Pro (When):
- 5 team members created (storage limit hit)
- 50 goals created (feature gates lock)
- Recruitment feature needed
- 30 days since signup + 3+ active users

Pro → Enterprise (When):
- 50+ team members
- Custom workflows needed
- API access required
- Dedicated support requested
- Annual contract preferred (better pricing)
```

#### Pricing Upgrade Messaging
```
Free tier limits hit:
"You've reached 5 team members. 
Upgrade to Pro to add unlimited team members and unlock advanced features."
CTA: "Upgrade to Pro ($49/month)"

Pro tier limits hit:
"You're getting great use out of Pro!
Enterprise offers dedicated support, custom workflows, and more.
Let's talk about your needs."
CTA: "Talk to Sales"
```

---

### 5.3 Churn Prevention

#### Early Warning Signs
```
Red flags (send outreach):
- No login for 7+ days
- Feature usage declining
- Support ticket with problem
- Long between goal updates
- Review cycles not started

Action:
- Email: "We miss you! Here's why Targetym helps..."
- Offer: Free upgrade to Pro for 1 month
- Personal: Success manager call
- Timing: Within 24 hours
```

#### Win-Back Campaigns
```
Churned customer (30 days no login):
- Email 1: "We'd love to have you back" (value prop)
- Email 2: "Here's what you're missing" (new features)
- Email 3: "Special offer" (50% off 1 month)
- Goal: 20% reactivation rate

Expected impact: Save 10-20% of churning customers
```

---

## PART 6: FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS & UNIT ECONOMICS

### 6.1 Unit Economics (Year 1)

#### Customer Acquisition Economics
```
Marketing spend: $20K (ProductHunt + content + outreach)
Expected new customers: 500
CAC: $40 per customer

Breakdown:
- ProductHunt: $5K → 100 customers (CAC $50)
- Direct sales: $5K → 150 customers (CAC $33)
- Content/organic: $5K → 150 customers (CAC $33)
- Partnerships: $5K → 100 customers (CAC $50)
```

#### Unit Economics by Tier
```
FREE TIER
CAC: $0 (organic)
LTV: $0 (no revenue)
Payback: N/A
Purpose: User acquisition funnel

PRO TIER
CAC: $40
LTV: 120 × $49 × 2 years = $11,760 (worst case)
LTV (actual): $3,000-5,000 (2-year avg retention)
Payback: 1-2 months ✅
ARR per customer: $588
Expansion: 20% (upgrades to Enterprise)

ENTERPRISE TIER
CAC: $100-200 (sales effort)
LTV: 36 × $300 × 3 years = $32,400
LTV (actual): $10,000-15,000 (2-3 year avg)
Payback: 2-3 months
ARR per customer: $3,600
Contract: 1-3 years
```

#### Annual Revenue Projection

```
Month 1: 50 customers × $35 avg = $1,750 MRR × 1 = $1,750
Month 2: 100 customers × $38 avg = $3,800 MRR × 2 = $7,600
Month 3: 150 customers × $42 avg = $6,300 MRR × 3 = $18,900
Month 4: 250 customers × $48 avg = $12,000 MRR × 4 = $48,000

Q1 Total: $1,750 + $7,600 + $18,900 = $28,250
Q2 Total: $48,000 × 3 = $144,000
Q3 Total: $75,000 × 3 (aggressive growth) = $225,000
Q4 Total: $100,000 × 3 (holiday + annual deals) = $300,000

YEAR 1 TOTAL: ~$700,000+ revenue
Average MRR end of year: $60,000

But first 4 months (our target):
Month 4 = $25,000 MRR ✅ TARGET HIT!

## PART 8: CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Must-Do (Non-Negotiable)

```
✅ 1. PAYMENT PROCESSOR
   Must work: Razorpay (India) + Stripe (Global)
   Why: Can't make revenue without it
   
✅ 2. ONBOARDING < 5 MINUTES
   Must achieve: 70% completion within 24h
   Why: Activation drives retention
   
✅ 3. AI FEATURES WORKING
   Must have: CV scoring active at launch
   Why: Key differentiator vs competitors
   
✅ 4. PRODUCTION RELIABILITY
   Must guarantee: 99.9% uptime on launch day
   Why: Poor launch = bad first impression
   
✅ 5. CUSTOMER SUPPORT
   Must provide: 24/7 coverage first week
   Why: Early feedback + bug fixes critical
```

### KPIs to Track Daily

```
Week 1-2 (Pre-Launch):
- Build velocity (features completed)
- Test coverage (% of new code tested)
- Bug count (should be near 0 by Day 14)

Week 1-2 (Launch):
- Sign-ups (target: 100/day from ProductHunt)
- Free → paid conversion (target: 30%)
- Onboarding completion (target: 70%)
- Churn (target: 0% first week)
- Support tickets (track for quality)
- Payment success rate (target: 99%+)
- Server uptime (target: 100%)
```

---

## PART 9: RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Payment Processing Failures
```
Risk: Razorpay/Stripe not accepting payments on launch
Impact: CRITICAL (no revenue)
Mitigation:
- Test both processors thoroughly (7 days minimum)
- Have fallback processor ready
- Stripe test mode → live mode gradual rollout
- 24/7 support for payment issues first week
```

### Risk 2: Low Onboarding Completion
```
Risk: <50% of users complete onboarding
Impact: HIGH (low activation = churn)
Mitigation:
- A/B test wizard flow (simplified vs detailed)
- Copy optimization (clear CTAs)
- Live tutorial videos
- In-app help tooltip
- Quick-start template
```

### Risk 3: Performance Issues at Scale
```
Risk: Site slow when 1000+ users sign up from ProductHunt
Impact: HIGH (bad first experience)
Mitigation:
- Load test with 5000 concurrent users
- Database indexing optimized
- Redis caching layer
- CDN for static assets
- Scale infrastructure before launch
```

### Risk 4: Insufficient Marketing Traction
```
Risk: <50 sign-ups from ProductHunt + organic
Impact: MEDIUM (slower revenue growth)
Mitigation:
- Prepare multiple launch channels (PH, HN, Twitter)
- Outreach to 500+ Indian startups (direct)
- SEO content ready for organic
- Partnerships setup
- Influencer outreach (HR tech space)
```

### Risk 5: Team Burnout
```
Risk: 2-week sprint is intense, team exhausted
Impact: MEDIUM (quality issues, bugs)
Mitigation:
- Realistic scope (MVP only, cut nice-to-have)
- Sleep > heroic coding
- Daily breaks
- Post-launch recovery time
- Celebrate wins
```

## CONCLUSION: YOUR PATH TO $100K MRR

### The Math
```
Month 1: $2K MRR (50 customers)
Month 4: $25K MRR (300+ customers) ← TARGET
Month 8: $60K MRR (600+ customers)
Month 12: $100K MRR (1000+ customers) ← GOAL

Key assumptions:
- 30% free-to-paid conversion

```

✅ 5. Expand existing customers (upsell to Enterprise)
✅ 6. Get word of mouth (amazing product experience)
```
